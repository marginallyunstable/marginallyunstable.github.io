_'Catches win matches'_ is probably the oldest adage in Cricket. A fielder may only be required to take one catch in an entire game, but his success in taking that catch may have a considerable effect on the outcome of the match. Application of technology to sports equipment has a great impact on performance and has a potential to revolutionize the entire sporting culture.

This work introduces KriCatch 1.0, the result of the first design iteration for a slip-catching practice system tailored for the game of Cricket. Traditional slip-catching systems involve a thrower throwing a ball toward a coach or passive equipment, which then redirects the ball for the practitioners' catching drills. However, these methods often fall short in delivering effective, versatile, and realistic catching practice. Recognizing this need for improvement, efforts were made to develop KriCatch and address these shortcomings.
