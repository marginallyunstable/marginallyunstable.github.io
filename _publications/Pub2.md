The paper presents a control method to catch a moving object with a joint actuated by means of a variable stiffness actuator. The controller is designed such that the variable stiffness joint acts as a virtual damper that absorbs the kinetic energy of the moving object. The virtual damping and the output stiffness of the variable stiffness actuator are the control variables. To obtain a critically damped system, the damping coefficient is scheduled on both the output stiffness and the inertia of the system. Experiments on the rotational variable stiffness actuator vsaUT-II validate the control method.
