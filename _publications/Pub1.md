The aim of this work was to estimate online, the impedance parameters, namely the damping and stiffness, of a variable impedance dynamic system, a variable impedance controlled KUKA LWR in this case. The estimation was performed using a Constrained Extended Kalman Filter (CEKF). Such estimations play important role for tasks involving online-tuning of the parameters of a variable impedance controlled robotic manipulator in contact with a
variable impedance dynamic environment, for example, during humanrobot physical interaction.
