Hi, I am a Systems Engineer within the Drive and Control group at Sioux, where I play a facilitate the development of high-tech, multi-disciplinary systems. I enjoy shouldering diverse roles spanning various phases in the Vee model of the systems engineering process. This, especially given that it helps me cultivate a holistic approach to problem-solving through systems thinking. My main interests lie in Control Design and System Dynamics, and I am passionate about applying my knowledge and experience to contribute innovative solutions to complex engineering challenges.

When I'm not geeking out, I can be found cooking, cycling, woodworking or spiraling down the the rabbit hole of random YouTube videos.
