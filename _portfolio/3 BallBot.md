BallBot is a mechanism which uses a single ball as its propulsion system, actuated by three omniwheels attached to the upper cylindrical body. The system can tilt spontaneously in any direction and can rotate about its own axis. The BallBot is this a __translating unstable inverted pendulum with five degrees of freedom.

The purpose of this project is twofold: (1) To model the dynamic behavior of the BallBot using __Bond-Graph modeling technique__ (2) Control and Stablize the motion of the BallBot.
