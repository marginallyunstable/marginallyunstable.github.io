This work is a study of variable stiffness actuators and their optimal control
strategies. If we look at the physical reasons and control principles that govern
movements of humans and animals, we can see that varying stiffness of their muscles forms an important
part of their actuation system.

This study provides a review of why and where are variable stiffness actuation
strategies can play crucial role, their physical realization methods and finally their optimal
control. A simulation of a ball catching task is studied using a 1 degree of freedom
link integrated with a variable stiffness actuator. Various optimal control problems
are studied, namely, Brachistochrone, Energy-maximization and Effort-reduction
problem.
