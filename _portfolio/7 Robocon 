Team Robocon, BITS Pilani participates in anually held ABU Robocon an Asian Oceanian College Robot Competition, in which teams have to design and fabricate a robot according to a given theme.

The theme for ROBOCON 2015 was to build to robots capable of playing a Badminton Doubles game.

I was In-charge of the Mechanical Subsystem of the team and was responsible for the designing and fabrication of the robot.

We tried to keep the Design as simple as possible. The Robot has 3+1 DOFs. Three of which come from the four Omni-directional wheels (Two Translation and One Twist about the robot's axis) and the fourth comes from the Pneumatic Rotary Actuator, which actuates the end-effector i.e. racquets.
