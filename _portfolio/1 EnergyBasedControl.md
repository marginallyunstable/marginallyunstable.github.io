This work presents an energy-based control approach to realize a variable impedance control task on a robotic manipulator. Introducing an energy tank into the system and aptly regulating its dynamics, it is made certain that the overall system i.e. the manipulator and the environment remains passive, thus ensuring a stable interaction. The presented method can be used to impose offline as well as online varying impedance profiles for a robotic manipulator. For example varying the impedance profile for a needle insertion task during a surgery, depending on the varying features of a tissue being operated.
