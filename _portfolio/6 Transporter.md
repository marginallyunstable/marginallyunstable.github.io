Transporter was an event at Kshitij, a technical festival held at IIT Kharagpur.

Problem Statement: was to design an Autonomous Robot capable of navigating a grid, detecting blocks and pits coming in its path and finally placing the blocks in pits by taking minimal paths.

Implemented Dijkstra's Graph Search Algorithm to navigate from present node to the target node, avoiding pits taking the shortest path and Hungarian Algorithm for the assignment of blocks to the pits. Here is a short video of the robot showing its skills in a 4*4 grid.
