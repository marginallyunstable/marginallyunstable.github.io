This work is studies the task of achieving In-Hand manipulation with simple robotic hands by exploiting Extrinsic Dexterity. In-Hand manipulation is the action of changing the pose of a grasped object with respect to the hand and Extrinsic Dexterity, is an In-Hand manipulation strategy to achieve dexterity by using resources extrinsic to the robot.

Extrinsic Dexterity can take three forms, namely, Quasi-static actions, Passive Dynamics actions and Active Dynamic actions. This work specifically studies the form of in-hand manipulation of a grasped object by pushing it against an external pusher (Quasi-static Action). This work involved the study of modeling the friction contact between the object and the robotic hand and the external contact as a _Mixed-Linear Complementarity Problem_. The model predicts the minimum force required from the external pusher to break the grasp equilibrium of the object in desired directions.
The model was evaluated using a primitive prehensile pushing action of straight sliding using different types of external contacts, namely point and line contact.
